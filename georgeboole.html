            <p><h4>
                George Boole was born on November 2nd 1815 and died on December 8 1864, born in Lincolnshire England. Boole first learned mathematics from his father when he was young which he developed a great interest in mathematics and after he learned all that his father could teach him Boole went out and taught himself what his father couldn't teach him. In 1841 Boole published his first paper that was titled "Researches on the Theory of Analytical Transformations." The paper's contents were about different equations and the algebraic problem of linear transformation, especially emphasizing on the concept of invariance. In 1844 Boole would be awarded the very first Royal Society's gold medal for mathematics because of the paper he wrote titled "On a General Method of Analysis," the paper talked about how algebra and calculus might be combined to create something greater. It wasn't long until Boole noticed that they were in fact able to create something greater from combining algebra and calculus. In 1847 Boole published a pamphlet called "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, being an Essay towards a Calculus of Deductive Reasoning"  ; the pamphlet's contents were about the idea that logic should be aligned with mathematics instead of philosophy. In 1849 Boole was appointed professor of mathematics at Queens College, County Cork. In 1854 Boole published a paper titled "An Investigation into the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities," it was regarded as a mature statement for his ideals. Boole started to make new math in 1847 which he completed and published in 1854 under the title "Laws of Thought" this type of math would later become known as Boolean algebra which would be used in so many different ways that Boole would have never imagined.
