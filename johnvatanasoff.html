                <h4>
                    John V. Atanasoff was born on October 4th 1903 and died on June 15th 1995, John was born and raised in Hamilton New York. In 1941 John Developed the ABC(Atanasoff-Berry Computer) with the purpose of breaking through the limitations of analog machines. The computer John had built would do just that; the computer had capacitors to store data in binary form and had electronic logic circuits to perform additional functions such as addition and subtraction. In 1946 John participated in the atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll and in 1952 John would establish the Ordnance Engineering Corporation although it would be short-lived as he sold it in 1956 to Aerojet General Corporation. John was much more intrigued in the ABC and wanted to patent it. The ABC had also sparked interest in others, not just John as J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and John Mauchly made the ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) in 1946 after looking at the ABC and getting inspiration from it.
