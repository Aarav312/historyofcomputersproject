                <h4>
                Charles Babbage was born on December 26 1791 and died on October 18 1871, Charles grew up in London England. In 1812 Charles helped build the Analytical Society with the main goal of introducing European literature into English mathematics. In 1816 Charles was elected to be a part of the Royal Society of London a great feat that would later help build the Royal Astronomical in 1820 and the Statistical societies in 1834. The idea sparked back in 1812 to Charles about mathematical tables he would make a small calculator that could only calculate up to 8 digits and some simple equations but it would start the train of ideas that Charles would have to create the Difference Engine, and in 1823 his long awaited idea would finally come to fruition Charles had secured government funding to build the difference machine. In 1830 Charles made plans for another machine but bigger, almost the size of a room which would also become the forerunner of modern digital computers.
