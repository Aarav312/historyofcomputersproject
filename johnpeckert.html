                John P Eckert/John W Mauchly
John W Mauchly was born on August 30th 1907 and died January 8th 1980, was born in Cincinnati Ohio US. John Mauchly and John Eckert were both engineer graduates sent to figure out ways to accelerate the recomputation of artillery firing tables. They figured that they could build a computer for this and so they went to work trying to figure it out. They eventually proposed the idea of an all purpose computer the ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) got approved so they went to work creating this beast of a machine that had more than 18,000 vacuum tabs. The ENIAC had features that John V. Atanasoff was created with the ABC(Atanasoff-Berry Computer). The ENIAC got to see its first real use in 1947 during a ballistics test for the US army. About a year later John P Eckert and John W Mauchly made a computer manufacturing firm. In 1949 they proudly announced that they were making another machine, the Binary Automatic Computer (BINAC). It intrigued quite some people since it used magnetic tape instead of punched cards. In 1950 the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation was bought by Remington Rand Inc and later on Sperry Rand Corporation obtained it. They made a third computer, the UNIVAC(Universal Automatic Computer). This machine was made for the purpose of handling business data.
